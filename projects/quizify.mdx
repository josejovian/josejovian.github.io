## Project Overview

Initially, this application was the final project of the Agile Software Development course that I took. I had worked in this project with four other people, and this project was done in a few sprints. However, I recreated this project from scratch by myself, using different technology stacks. There were things that I could have done better, so instead of refactoring most of the initial codebase, I decided to just start over with different technologies, but there were still some code brought over to the new version from the old version. I also wanted to test out NextJS's built-in API feature.

Quizify is an application, where people can create, do and review quizzes. The features of the remade application, remain identical with its first iteration.

## Tech Stacks and Libraries

This project now uses NextJS and MongoDB (initially, it was React and Firebase), and the styling is done using Tailwind. The following are some of the libraries that were used, which helped the creation of some features of the application or sped up the development process.

- **Bcrypt**, to handle encryption of user passwords.
- **Cslx**, for simplified class writing, to be used in conjunction with Tailwind.
- **Formik**, to handle form validation.
- **Yup**, for validation schemas, to be used in conjunction with Formik.
- **Interweave**, to handle displaying/parsing HTML.
- **Quill**, for easy WYISWYG editor.

## Highlighted Features

### Account Login/Register

The account system is made from scratch. The register and login features use Formik for form validations. The registration also uses helper libraries like Bcrypt for password encryption before storing them in Mongo database. In the initial counterpart, the project just used Firebase's account feature.

### CRUD Quiz

This feature is an important feature in this application, but in terms of algoritm, the codebase for editing the quizzes are mostly similar to the old ones. In the remake version, the users can add a picture for a question, and the pictures of questions (if any) are stored as base64 in the database.

Moreover, in the initial version, the controls for editing quizzes are displayed regardless whether the user is editing that quiz or not. In the remake version, the controls are only displayed if the user is focusing on a question, that is, they click on it.

### Do/Review Quiz

In the old version of the app, when users work on a quiz, the timer could easily be frozen/stopped if the user switches tab. This was an issue that we noticed too late, so we did not fix it.

Initially, an interval function is used to **reduce the timer as each second passes**. This was definitely not the smartest idea, due to how many potential issues can appear, such as the one that was mentioned previously, so, one solution that I came up with, is to use interval function to **calculate the difference between the current time and the time where the user started the quiz**.

Using this new approach, it would be easier to reliably manage the timer and track when the user would run out of time. It also does not matter at all if the user switches tab, the timer will still be accurately calculated. Though, in the new version, the app provides neither toast notification nor visualized timer to remind the user how much time is left, unlike the old version.

In terms of functionality, the review quiz feature remains the same in the new version, so apart form the fact that I did not exactly reuse the old code, there are nothing worth mentioning about this particular feature.
