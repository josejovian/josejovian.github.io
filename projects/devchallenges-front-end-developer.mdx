## Project Overview

This is a group of front-end mini projects from DevChallenges. DevChallenges provides several challenges related to Front End Development, and we are required to fulfill all mandatory user stories and also follow the designs. I have made sure to do so.
  
I did not exactly complete these mini projects in proper sequence, and for the last three projects that I completed, they are made using Typescript.

### Reusable Components
![Reusable Components Storybook](/_next/image?url=%2Fprojects%2Freusable-components.png&w=3840&q=75 "Reusable Components Storybook")

[demo](https://josejovian.github.io/devchallenges-front-end-developer/reusable-components/storybook-static) | [repo](https://github.com/josejovian/devchallenges-front-end-developer/tree/main/reusable-components)

The first two challenges are just *the creation of reusable components*, button and input, so I just merged them into one same repository. I also used *Storybook* to easily display different variants or states of the reusable components.

### WindBNB

[demo](https://josejovian.github.io/devchallenges-front-end-developer/windbnb/build/) | [repo](https://github.com/josejovian/devchallenges-front-end-developer/tree/main/windbnb)

A simple web app where users can *see listings of premade living places to rent*, and the users can also *filter the listings based on number of guests and preselected locations*. This is a React + Tailwind project, written in Typescript.

### Todo App

[demo](https://josejovian.github.io/todo-app/) | [repo](https://github.com/josejovian/todo-app)

This is a React + SCSS project.

### Random Quote Generator

[demo](https://josejovian.github.io/random-quote-generator) | [repo](https://github.com/josejovian/random-quote-generator)

This is a React + SCSS project, and it uses [QuoteGarden API](https://pprathameshmore.github.io/QuoteGarden/).

### Country Quiz

![Country Quiz](/_next/image?url=%2Fprojects%2Fcountry-quiz.png&w=3840&q=75 "Country Quiz")

[demo](https://josejovian.github.io/country-quiz) | [repo](https://github.com/josejovian/country-quiz)

This is a React + SCSS project, and it uses [RestCountries API](https://restcountries.com/).

### Weather App

![Weather App](/_next/image?url=%2Fprojects%2Fweather-app.png&w=3840&q=75 "Weather App")

[demo](https://ephemeral-chimera-37acac.netlify.app/build/) | [repo](https://github.com/josejovian/devchallenges-front-end-developer/tree/main/weather-app)

A simple web app where users can *see the weather of preselected locations, or their own location* (if allowed). This is a React + Tailwind project, written in Typescript. It also uses [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

### Jobs

![Weather App](/_next/image?url=%2Fprojects%2Fjobs.png&w=3840&q=75 "Weather App")

[demo](https://ephemeral-chimera-37acac.netlify.app/build/) | [repo](https://github.com/josejovian/devchallenges-front-end-developer/tree/main/jobs)

A simple web app where users can *search jobs based on a key word, and even filter specific locations of the job*. This is a NextJS + Tailwind project, written in Typescript. It also uses [Google Jobs API from SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/google-jobs-api).

I thought since the user are supposed to be able to view job details, it would be as a separate page (e.g. domain/jobs/id), so NextJS's routing feature would come into play. However, since the API only gives job listing based on a query, I made everything in a single page, but I still ended up using NextJS's API feature because I cannot directly use the Jobs API due to CORS, so creating another API in NextJS to communicate with the Jobs API worked well to resolve this issue.
