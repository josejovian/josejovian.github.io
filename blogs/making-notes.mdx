We probably have taken one or two notes of our classes or lectures. Were you ambitious as a student? Have you tried hard to keep getting perfect or high scores? If you answered yes to either question, you probably had taken taking notes more seriously than your peers. That's understandable because one way of getting into state universities in Indonesia is through SNMPTN. Since we were competing with other students, we would have had a higher chance of success if we had gotten excellent scores throughout our high school years.

In high school, I didn't really have a hobby, but I did play games a lot. You could probably consider that as a hobby. My laptop was only decent at the time, but that wasn't a problem since I have been playing specific games, and I am not the type to buy/play new games when they come out. Despite this, I still took studying quite seriously back in high school. I even had a habit of making notes before exams and printing them, so I could review them later in the class before the exam started. Though, you may soon find this useless.

I probably was the only one in my class that spent (or wasted) too much time making notes. I've also consistently done this trend through three years of high school. Despite this, I did not put too much thought into my future. Although I decided to enter the computer science field when I was young, I never thought of taking SNMPTN or SBMPTN. The latter is just another method to get into state universities. It's a written test consisting of several subjects. My friends were also enrolled in an additional preparation course to prepare for it.

Yes, as you may have thought, I could've instead exerted my energy and free time studying for SBMPTN. I haven't regretted my decision because I'm entering CS. It's not like I would've successfully entered a state university if I had decided to do SBMPTN anyway. I would still have a little chance of success, to be fair.

I didn't have a hobby and wasted most of my free time making notes for classes during my high school years. So, it should also be apparent why my university projects or personal projects are about education, or learning-related stuff, like Quizify or LADE. At least my thesis group is working on a proposal about an application unrelated to the above topics. I hope that won't age like milk.

Aside from printing notes, I also bought two folio books, which I used to make Mathematics and Physics notes to prepare for the state exams. I also made those notes available online on my old unmaintained blog site. Those two subjects were the only subjects where my brain cells worked the most. I suppose this was because I preferred maths to any other subject. I got satisfying scores (a perfect score for Mathematics) in the state exam for those subjects. In the context of note-taking, I would say these state exam scores proved my note-taking was successful and paid off. I am not sure if these scores would help you in SNMPTN, but either way, these scores remain meaningless for me since I never took SNMPTN anyway.

Although I made some handwritten notes in a binder book when I entered university, that only lasted for (a grand total of) one semester. I did continue making some notes online, but only for two semesters. I didn't continue making notes. I suppose this is because as I go along the university curriculum over the years, more courses are becoming project-oriented.

To close this unorganized blog post, I suppose making notes has been the studying method that suits me the most. It is also an old habit that I slowly abandoned. I probably will create and post some Front End Development-related posts in the future, so this post is not the only blog post I will ever make. Thanks for reading.
